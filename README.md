Ensuring smooth deployment of an application typically involves numerous people and procedures - commonly known as DevOps. So what happened when Tailwind Traders brought in a team of interns to improve the their static sites over the summer? Fortunately, DevOps need not be complex. Let's see how the team used Azure Static Web Apps and GitHub Actions to "do the DevOps" and manage a successful project.

This demo provides you with a static hugo blog to demonstrate how GitHub Actions and Azure Static Web Apps work together to provide you with CI/CD expereince with just a few clicks.

## Requirements

* [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/)
* [GitHub](https://github.com/)
* CLI - Your local computer or [Azure Cloud Shell](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/developer/terraform/get-started-cloud-shell?WT.mc_id=devops-0000-jagord)
* Azure Account - [$200 Free Credit](https://cda.ms/1zH)

## Installation, Deployment and more

**Fork, Clone Repo, and enter directory**

[Fork the repository within GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo).

```bash
git clone git@github.com:jaydestro/twtintern.git
cd twtintern
```

**OPTIONAL - Test local install** (not for Cloud Shell)

The first command will build the static content from the `content/` directory.  The second command will start the demo server locally on your workstation  

```bash
hugo 
hugo server -D 
```

**Output should be**

```@Serving pages from memory
Running in Fast Render Mode. For full rebuilds on change: hugo server --disableFastRender
Web Server is available at http://localhost:1313/ (bind address 127.0.0.1)
Press Ctrl+C to stop
```

Ctrl+C  to Exit.

**Deployment to Azure**

1. open Azure portal, type in search bar "Static Web Apps (Preview)"
2. Click "Add"
